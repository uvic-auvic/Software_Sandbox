# ROS Topics

As mentioned previously, Topics are a way to transmit/recieve a continuous stream of data. On one end you have subscribers funnelling data into a topic and on the other end you have subscribers recieving and handling the data. This mechanism provides separation of the 2 entities and ensures their logic doesn't get mixed up.

# Publishers

You can have multiple publishers all publishing to a topic. A simple publisher can be found [here](/ros/src/topic/src/publisher.cpp)

# Subscribers

You can have multiple subscribers subscribed to a topic. A simple subscriber can be found [here](/ros/src/topic/src/subscriber.cpp)
